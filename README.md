# QuizApp
An App to make simple Quizs

## Purpose
- It is an example of the ModelViewModel architecture and package organization.
- I have followed the SOLID principles in the realization of the code.
- 

## Notes
Uses technologies and versions, already tested in other applications of mine, (you can see in my repositories)

I would have liked to change the static 'Quiz' object, share it differently with the ViewModels.
And change the color theme
